System Call Development
=======================

The aim of this project is to develop a system call in the Linux kernel.

You must add a system call directly in the kernel sources, compile your kernel
and use your new system call. You will also have to provide a patch of your
modifications along with a README file explaining the process of sources
modification and kernel building.

Corrections will take place on your computers.

Use the blih/git repository Kernel_SysCall to turn-in your work before the date
specified on the intranet.
