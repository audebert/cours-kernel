<u>Device Driver Development</u><br><br>

The aim of this project is to develop a serial driver in a Linux Kernel<br>
(or NetBSD, then you will have to use the generic methods : Probe, Attach,<br>
Detach).<br><br>

Your driver should be able to transfer data without loss or scrambling,<br>
from a computer to another via the Serial port. You have to initialize <br>
the port and use both Data/Line Status registers to send and receive<br>
data.<br><br>

Automatic management of /dev/ node is highly recommended<br><br>

You can use virtual machines capacities for the tests<br><br>

Corrections will take place on your computers.

Use the blih/git repository Kernel_SerialDriver to turn-in your work before the date<br>
specified on the intranet.<br>
